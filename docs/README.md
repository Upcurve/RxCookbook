# The ReactiveX Cookbook
> A list of hand-curated recipes to help you get started with ReactiveX on any platform.

## What's the big deal?
**ReactiveX** can seem daunting at first, especially when you don't have a clue how to use this tech in the real world.

Most tutorials that are already present on the web are focused on how to write ReactiveX code on various languages like **Java**, **Swift**, etc.

They're lacking the part where you learn to think reactively and have that **a-ha** moment.

This cookbook is aimed at solving that issue.

## Features
* Focuses on the _why_
* Has _real-world_ examples for using **ReactiveX**
* Snippets featured in multiple languages
* Super _slim_ making it a quick-read

## What's the damage here?
Unlike most guides, this one is completely **free**. There are no **paywalls** or **advertisements**. It's accessible to anyone willing to learn.
